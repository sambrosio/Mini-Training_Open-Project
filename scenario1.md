Stefan would like to suggest that the Open Science Trainer Handbook is translated into Spanish since a big part of the community speaks spanish. To make this suggestion he creates and issue on GitHub in the OSTH repository.

Possible things to discuss:

- For what kind of tasks and needs can you use issues?
- What would be a good way to communicate issues?

To be aware:
* Communication: Tone, Face, have a purpose, respectful, choose the right forum
* Bugs: relevant information, reproduce, screenshot, OS details
* Feature request
* Expectations: can, but not must.
