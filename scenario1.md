Stefan would like to suggest that the Open Science Trainer Handbook is translated into Spanish since a big part of the community speaks spanish. To make this suggestion he creates and issue on GitHub in the OSTH repository.

Possible things to discuss:

- For what kind of tasks and needs can you use issues?
- What would be a good way to communicate issues?
