Heidi reads the Open Science Trainer Handbook and finds some typos. She goes to the GitHub repository where the handbook is hosted and creates a pull request with fixes of these typos. A pull request is a suggestion for an update of files. The people who organise the handbook can then decide if they want to accept the typo fixes Heidi suggests. They can also have a discussion about the changes.


Possible things to discuss:
- Would you be comfortable to create a pull request for the OST handbook as well?
- Does this process of pull requests make sense to you?

To be aware:
- Documentation (README.md): mission statement, good name, Description, Useage, Comm Channels, Contribute, Releases, Status of project, people, 
- Licensing & openness
- Privacy
- directory structure
- social: watch, star, comment,...
