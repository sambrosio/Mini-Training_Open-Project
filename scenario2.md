Heidi reads the Open Science Trainer Handbook and finds some typos. She goes to the GitHub repository where the handbook is hosted and creates a pull request with fixes of these typos. A pull request is a suggestion for an update of files. The people who organise the handbook can then decide if they want to accept the typo fixes Heidi suggests. They can also have a discussion about the changes.

Would you be comfortable to create a pull request for the OST handbook as well?
