Susana wants to create a repository to share the mini training she is doing for the open science trainer bootcamp with the global open science community. Susana, Heidi and Stefan can collaborate and create new content using this repository.

Possible things to discuss:

- What do you think is a repository?
- Why do you think a repository is useful/important?
