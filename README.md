__Preparation:__ Put sticky notes with 3 different colors on the chairs (for 3 groups)


### Intro and moving into groups (2 Minutes)

Heidi does this part

- Purpose of mini-training: introduce you into how you can use github to manage your science project and colaborate with others.
- useage of the open science training handbook as an example how you can contribute and update another project, and even start your own. 
- Question: Who of you already used GitHub?
- Agenda: 
  - group discussion with short introduction into the task (5min)
  - presentation of outcomes (30s)

- you were all part of a bigger story.


#### Group 1: Stefan
How to give feedback to the gitbook? -> Create an issu

- Stefan shows some existing issues and how to create an own.


#### Group 2: Heidi
How to improve the gitbook? -> Create a pull request.

- Heidi shows her pull request she created for the Open Science Trainer Handbook



#### Group 3: Susana
How to start an own open project? -> create new repository.

- Susana shows how to start a new repository
- A repository is where you store your files
- You can change the files and all old versions are available
- The repository usually contains a README file, which describes the content of the repository

### Plenary / Wrapup (6 Minutes)

Stefan organizes this part

- Explaination of scenario 1 and questions (30s): Here is our story: We are looking out for open science training materials so we asked a search machine on this. Fortunately, we found the amazing open science training handbook on GitHub. While watching it, we found some minor spelling errors and we had an idead for a new feature. So as it is, on GitHub you create an issue for this. So the group then discussed for what you could use issues, and what kind of communication style would be appreciated.
- wrap up of group discussion from scenario 1 (30s)
- add thoughts to scenario 1
- Explaination of scenario 2 and questions (30s): So, next we want to add some updates we made to the gitbook to improve it. This is done via a Pull Request, where we can ask the gitbook project to accept our changes. Heidi showed the group her example and the discussed the reasonableness of a PR and if they feel comfortable to apply it.
- wrap up of group discussion from scenario 2 (30s)
- add thoughts to scenario 2
- Explaination of scenario 3 and questions (30s): after we created our PR, the gitbook project team gets in contact with us and writes us an Email. In it, they ask us to share also our work on github, so they can add and link our Mini-Training as reference to the gitbook. With total excitement we agree and want to create our first public available and open repository on GitHub.
- wrap up of group discussion from scenario 3 (30s)
- add thoughts to scenario 3


Thanks for participating
